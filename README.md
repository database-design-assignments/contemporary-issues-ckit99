## Academia and Industry Meet to reimagine the AI Graduate 

This article, written by Daniel Gutierezz and published on insideBigData, outlines the talent gap for graduates well versed in AI in a market where demand for AI jobs will skyrocket in the coming years.

This article, written by Daniel Gutierezz and published on insideBigData, outlines the talent gap for graduates well versed in AI in a market where demand for AI jobs will skyrocket in the coming years. I Gutierezz first outlined how most education systems around the world have failed to teach students the necessary skills to work in fields like AI, leaving individuals who want to pursue a career in AI to acquire the skills themselves. This has consequently led to a deficit of AI ready talent, whose demand will continue to skyrocket. Demand for AI talent has tripled from 2015 to 2019, and that trend will continue to accelerate. I think that this is a serious economic problem, as many firms across virtually every industry are beginning to apply AI and Data Analytics in their business practices, and demand for these workers will be critical to businesses achieving their maximum potential. Not having enough talent will lead to a massive loss in potential productivity, and unless there are solutions to this talent shortage then our society will not achieve maximum benefit. 

Guiterezz also explained how some countries are beginning to reform their education system to meet this demand in AI talent. In China, schools are beginning to incorporate future technology classes to prepare students to be AI engineers or Data scientists for jobs in data analytics, computer science, software engineering, and AI research. Ireland launched a Masters in AI program in 2018 to prepare graduates with the necessary AI skills to work in the AI industry. I believe that all countries should begin to increase their investment in AI education, as the number of AI ready workers a country has will directly impact their economic productivity and overall wellbeing. These programs will eventually produce enough talent to meet the demand for AI workers in the long run, but there is a massive short run opportunity for those with AI skills. This article motivates me to achieve data literacy and hopefully one day become versed in AI, as the field is becoming increasingly important. I’m fortunate to be at the start of this trend and already gaining skills, as they will be invaluable in the 40 year career ahead of me as AI becomes universal.

## Google Launches Data Analytics Solution to Expand Vaccine Access


Google has announced its Google Cloud’s Intelligent Vaccine Impact Solution. It will help increase the availability of vaccines and promote equitable access of the vaccines to populations who are most at risk, while helping governments disseminate accurate information to increase confidence in and acceptance of the vaccine. By combining machine learning with knowledge on epidemiology, they have produced a model that will assist with Covid-19 forecasting and analysis. This is the first part of the solution, which I think is highly critical to winning the war against Covid. By using this model, governments and public sector leaders across the world can see how their local outbreak’s forecast changes with alterations to policy decisions, giving us the necessary knowledge on how to best fight the virus in any given situation. As with any machine learning model, its accuracy improves as we feed it more data. In the future, I believe that this model will help us fight new pandemic outbreaks as data analytics takes center stage in our healthcare industry. 

The second component of the Intelligent Vaccine Impact Solution is the dissemination of medically accurate information about the vaccine. I’ve personally been overwhelmed by the sheer amount of “fake news” surrounding the pandemic and the vaccine, as well as the absurdity of some claims. The Covid-19 pandemic is perhaps the greatest test of human cooperation, as it really takes everybody’s commitment for us to have a chance of beating back the virus. In my opinion, the United States has been an utter failure at that task due to significant groups of the population making decisions based on false information. Conspiracy theories have demonized the vaccine to such an extent that many people are refusing to take it, compromising the end goal of herd immunity. If Google Cloud is able to provide a trusted, accurate, and easily accessible source of information on the covid-19 vaccine and pandemic, it could lead to a higher acceptance rate of the vaccine due to Google’s credibility. While there will always be some groups that reject Google’s research and information, this should be a net positive on the vaccine rollout.
